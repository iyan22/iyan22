# Hi! I am Iyán Álvarez 🪴
I am passionate about coding and teaching. The thrill of solving complex problems through programming drives me every day. I believe in the power of knowledge sharing, which is why I love teaching. Whether it's introducing beginners to the basics of programming or guiding advanced students through intricate concepts, I find immense satisfaction in helping others learn and grow. My aim is to inspire a new generation of coders who are as enthusiastic about technology as I am.
